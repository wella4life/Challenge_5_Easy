 - Users should be able to:
   - View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

 - What I Learned:
   - Having the picture inside a backgroud-div helps a lot
   - Having the picture become absolute and getting it into the -ve pushed the picture into position
   - Using calc() helped a lot with centering a lot of things
   - Flex and Grid can be used interchangeably
 
 - What I Couldn't Do:
   - Mobile version was very weird to make with how the content was oriented in size
   - Size difference was a little off
